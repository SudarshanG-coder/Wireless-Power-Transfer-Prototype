## 📊 Results and Discussion

The wireless charging system was successfully demonstrated using a 9V battery as the power source. Key observations:

* ✅ Effective power transfer was achieved up to **6 cm** with good coil alignment
* ⚡ Mobile devices charged reliably at **5V regulated output**
* 🔥 Minimal heat dissipation and good energy conversion efficiency
* 📶 Electromagnetic interference was found to be negligible in the tested range

These results confirm the feasibility of short-range wireless charging for low-power devices using inductive coupling.
